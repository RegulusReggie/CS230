SourcererCC_visualizer.html is a light weight, easy-to-use tool helps annotating code clones detected by SourcererCC easier! To use this tool, download corpus data and unzip each one. Copy and paste data files, with .stats file and .pairs file generated by SourcererCC to one single folder. Upload this folder to start using the visualizer!

extractRFunction.py is an extension script to SourcererCC for it to detect clones in R.

utils/find_random_existence.py finds the common clones found by both tools.

utils/kappa.py is used to calculate kappa ratio

utils/findSameFileSimilar.py is used to locate any same file clones detected by SimilaR. However there is none.

This repo also contains some other scripts which we use to solve some problems we have when integrating results from all parties.
